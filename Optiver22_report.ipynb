This section should clearly describe who was responsible for generating the data, tuning the machine, performing the processing, writing the code, making observations, deploying the final product and writing/editing the report.  This should take the form of one paragraph of approximately 50 words (and no more than 200 words) summarizing the student's contribution. All group members should agree and acknowledge this component as an accurate reflection of each other's individual contributions. This component doesn't contribute to the overall word limit of your report. \n"

    "Reaearch question: How can short-term volatility forecasts improve bid-ask spread quoting strategies for HFT firms, and how does inter-stock correlation affect prediction accuracy and quoting performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "In high-frequency trading (HFT), market makers generate profit by repeatedly quoting bid and ask prices and earning the spread, while managing execution risk. As Deloitte (2015) notes, “these high frequency traders made prices by manually coordinating offers and taking on the risks of buying and selling shares in return for spread.” Accurately forecasting short-term volatility enables dynamic spread adjustments, helping balance profitability with risk. However, prediction performance may vary across assets, particularly when inter-stock correlations differ — which can influence both signal strength and quoting effectiveness.\n",
